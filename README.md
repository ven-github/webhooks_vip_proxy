# webhooks_vip_proxy

This is a dropwizard application which has APIs which I am using to create webhooks for Twitter, Instagram, and Facbook page and use it to receive webhook events via this API.

I have deployed this API in heroku.

Corresponding heroku app - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dropwizard-app-scs-webhooks

The heroku app uses the Procfile to depict how to run this java app
